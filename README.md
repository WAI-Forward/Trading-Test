# Trading-Test Flask App

This repository now contains a minimal [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) application with a single JSON endpoint.

## Getting Started

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your browser to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the JSON greeting.

The server runs with `debug=True` for development convenience. Do not enable debug mode in production.
